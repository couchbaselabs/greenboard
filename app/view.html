            <br />
            <p style="text-align:justify">Deleting jobs in jenkins will no longer delete the entry from greenboard going forward.
              This is because rerunning a job has to improve the results in general and the data should not be fudged
              in the dashboard in principle. However having said that,  if you absolutely must delete a job entry from greenboard, run
              <a href="http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/delete_jobs_from_greenboard" target="_blank">
                http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/delete_jobs_from_greenboard </a> job.
              The job takes following parameters.
            </p>
            <ol class="text-left">
              <li>version : Build version from where the job has to be deleted ex: 7.0.0-1234</li>
              <li>jobs_url : Full job url with the build_id which has to be deleted from greenboard.
                ex: http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_executor/196463/</li>
              <li>target : Which product to delete the job from. (server, cblite, sync_gateway)</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              Run the above job to delete any particular line from the job. A capability to delete from the greenboard
              will be added in the future based on the need.

            <p style="text-align:justify">
              To delete a job from the pending jobs list, run

                http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/delete_jobs_from_existing_jobs_greeenboard/ </a> job. This will make the
              greenboard ignore showing the job from a particular version until it's run at some later point in time.
              The job takes following parameters.
            </p>
            <ol class="text-left">

              This will delete the job from run details and will show up on pending jobs. Also rerun data will be
              deleted and rerunning the job will make it a fresh run.
              The job takes following parameters.

            <h4 class="modal-title">Known issues</h4>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              Since the new greenboard relies on eventing to gather data, it sometimes happens that the deleted data might
              get re-written back in the database. This is due to data race condition that is currently hard to solve since
              eventing does not support cas based inserts. Please re-run the above job if the data re-appears on the
              greenboard.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              You might see some differences in numbers in the failed jobs. This is due to the fact that there is a bug
              in the old collector that assigns incorrect number to the total number of tests in the job based on the last
              job it processed. So while the fix for this bug is made available, please note that both the numbers shown
              on both greenboard (new and old) are wrong. This issue is seen on jobs where
              the job had not generated any test results, usually the case with install failures.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3 class="modal-title" >Old greenboard</h3>
            <br />
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              Old greenboard is still functional for a while incase you want to use the old, but slower greenboard.
              Know that new features will not be enabled on greenboard going forward. The old greenboard can be accessed
              by clicking on the Greenboard(Old) icon on top of the page. Note that you might need VPN to access this link
              as of now.

              Contact Bharath G P (bharath.gp@couchbase.com) in case you face any issues. Also please report any bugs
              you see in the greenboard. While this has been tested quite extensively, it's still a software like our
              product. Hence there will be issues and bugs in the code
